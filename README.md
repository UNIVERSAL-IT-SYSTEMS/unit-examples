Example Units
=====

A collection of systemd units designed to run on CoreOS/fleet.
Blog posts and other documentation that contain example units are contained in folders within this repository.
Running these units with fleet is as simple as `cd blog-vulcan-example` and start running `fleetctl start` commands.
